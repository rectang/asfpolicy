## Release Distribution Channels ## {#channels}

The ASF's official channel for distribution of current Apache software
releases to the general public is `www.apache.org/dist`, augmented by the
Apache mirror network.

The public may also obtain Apache software from any number of "downstream"
channels which redistribute our releases in either original or derived form.
The vast majority of such downstream channels operate independently of Apache.

Apache Infrastructure maintains certain "developer" distribution channels
which facilitate distribution of unreleased software to consenting members of
a development community.

Finally, all historic Apache releases may be obtained from archive.apache.org.
