# Release Distribution Policy # {#policy}

This policy governs the distribution of Apache software releases
through channels maintained by Apache Infrastructure.  It complements Apache
[Release Policy](http://www.apache.org/dev/release), which governs how to
create releases.

## Release Distribution Channels ## {#channels}

The Apache Software Foundation's official channel for distribution of current
Apache software releases to the general public is `www.apache.org/dist`.  It
is augmented by the ASF mirror network.

The public may also obtain Apache software from any number of downstream
channels which redistribute our releases in either original or derived form.
The vast majority of such downstream channels operate independently of Apache.

Infrastructure maintains a number of developer-only channels which facilitate
distribution of unreleased software to consenting members of a development
community.

Finally, all historic Apache releases may be obtained from
`archive.apache.org`.
