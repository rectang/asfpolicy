# Release Distribution Policy # {#policy}

This policy governs the distribution of Apache software releases
through channels maintained by Apache Infrastructure.  It complements Apache
[Release Policy](http://www.apache.org/dev/release), which governs how to
create releases.

## Release Distribution Channels ## {#channels}

The ASF's official channel for distribution of current Apache software
releases to the general public is `www.apache.org/dist`, augmented by the
Apache mirror network.

The public may also obtain Apache software from any number of "downstream"
channels which redistribute our releases in either original or derived form.
The vast majority of such downstream channels operate independently of Apache.

Apache Infrastructure maintains certain "developer" distribution channels
which facilitate distribution of unreleased software to consenting members of
a development community.

Finally, all historic Apache releases may be obtained from archive.apache.org.

## Release content ### {#release-content}

### Official releases ### {#official-releases}

The content of official Apache releases and the process by which they are
created is governed by Apache [Release
Policy](http://www.apache.org/dev/release).

A release starts when the project community agrees to make a release.
However, no release manager can make a valid release unless the community
has taken the necessary steps to prepare in advance. The source code and
build process must comply with the legal and intellectual property
requirements for a [valid](#valid) release, and the project must have the
infrastructure in place to correctly [sign](#sign) the release artifacts.

### Binary packages ### {#binary-packages}

Release Policy [specifies](http://www.apache.org/dev/release#what) that binary
packages provided by third parties which meet certain criteria may be
distributed alongside official source packages.  Such packages are sometimes
referred to as "convenience binaries" to distinguish them from other binary
packages.

### Developer packages ### {#dev-packages}

## Public distribution ## {#public-distribution}

The Apache infrastructure *must* be the primary source for all artifacts
officially released by the ASF.

The Apache Infrastructure team maintains the Apache release distribution
infrastructure. This infrastructure has two parts: the mirrored directories
on `www.apache.org` and the Maven repository on `repository.apache.org`.

ASF releases typically contain additional material together with the source
package. This material may include documentation concerning the release but
must contain LICENSE and NOTICE files. As mentioned above, these artifacts
must be signed by a committer with a detached signature if they are to be
placed in the project's distribution directory.

Again, these artifacts may be distributed only if they contain LICENSE and
NOTICE files. For example, the Java artifact format is based on a
compressed directory structure and those projects wishing to distribute
jars must place LICENSE and NOTICE files in the META-INF directory within
the jar.

The KEYS file is a plain text file containing the public key signatures of
the release managers (and optionally other committers) for the project.

## Distribution of developer packages ## {#dev-distribution}

In the traditional open source development methodology practiced
at volunteer liability-limiting organizations like Apache, it is necessary to draw
clear distinctions between public resources that represent works "in-progress"
and works suitable for consumption by the public at large.
The purpose of a clear line is to inform our legal strategy of providing
protection for formal participants involved in producing releases, as defined
in the next section.  In-progress assets are viewed as controlled distributions
designed for self-identifying participants in project development, who are
primarily following the project's development lists.  Uncontrolled distributions,
aka releases, are what this policy document is designed to cover.

Were we to avoid drawing this distinction, and instead encouraged users to interact
directly with source control or nightly builds, it would be very difficult for
the organization to offer legal protection to Apache committers and PMC members
who have only exercised their own judgement in making software modifications
without the benefit of an **authorized business decision** approving of the distribution
of those artifacts as-is to the public at large.

Releases are, by definition, anything that is published beyond the group
that owns it. In our case, that means any publication outside the group of
people on the product dev list. If the general public is being instructed
to download a package, then that package has been released. Each PMC must
obey the ASF requirements on [approving any release](#approving-a-release). 
How you label the package is a secondary issue, described below.

During the process of developing software and preparing a release, various
packages are made available to the developer community for testing
purposes. **Do not include any links on the project website that might
encourage non-developers to download and use nightly builds, snapshots,
release candidates, or any other similar package.** The only people who are
supposed to know about such packages are the people following the dev list
(or searching its archives) and thus aware of the conditions placed on the
package. If you find that the general public are downloading such test
packages, then remove them.

Under no circumstances are unapproved builds a substitute for releases. If
this policy seems inconvenient, then release more often. Proper release
management is a key aspect of Apache software development.

- **Test Packages** are not Apache releases. All releases require due
process and official approval. Test packages are for testing ongoing
development and should only be discussed on the project development lists.

- **Nightly Builds** are simply built from the Subversion trunk,
usually once a day. These packages are intended for regular testing of
the build process and to give automated testers a common build for
regression testing. They are not intended for use by the general
public.

- **Release Candidates** are packages that have been proposed for
approval as a release but have not yet been approved by the project.
These packages are intended for developers (and users who follow the
development discussions) to test and report back to the project
regarding their opinions on the package quality compared to prior
releases. Many release candidates are possible prior to a release
approval. Users that are not interested in development testing should
wait until a release is formally approved.

- **Releases** are packages that have been approved for general public
release, with varying degrees of caveat regarding their perceived quality
or potential for change. Releases that are intended for everyday usage by
non-developers are usually referred to as "stable" or "general availability
(GA)" releases. Releases that are believed to be usable by testers and
developers outside the project, but perhaps not yet stable in terms of
features or functionality, are usually referred to as "beta" or "unstable".
Releases that only represent a project milestone and are intended only for
bleeding-edge developers working outside the project are called "alpha".

Test packages are for use by consenting developers and interested community
members only, so they should not be hosted or linked on pages intended for end
users.  They should not be mirrored; only blessed GA releases should be
mirrored.

Projects typically use `http://people.apache.org/~${RM}/**` or the newer
[`/dev` tree of the `dist` repository](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev)
or the staging features of repository.apache.org
to host release candidates posted for developer testing/voting (prior to being,
potentially, formally blessed as a GA release).

## Release distribution area ## {#dist-area}

Note that the PMC is responsible for all artifacts in their distribution
directory, which is a subdirectory of `www.apache.org/dist/` ; and all
artifacts placed in their directory must be signed by a committer,
preferably by a PMC member.

By committing your release tarballs to the appropriate subdirectory (i.e. TLP name) of the
[`https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/`](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/)
repository.  [`svnpubsub`](infrastructure) will push the files to [the master
mirror site](https://www.apache.org/dist/) immediately.  The 24-hour wait for
mirrors is still required though (as [mirrors use an 1/N-daily
rsync](../info/how-to-mirror) to catch up with the `dist/` tree).

The repository directory
`https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/<TLP name>/`
is for official releases only, i.e. archives (+ sigs, hashes) that have been approved
by the PMC.

There is also a development area under
`https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/<TLP name>/`
which can be used for development releases.
For example snapshots and release candidates can be stored here.  One important item to note, 
is that this directory does not get published to the mirrors via svnpubsub.  It is intended to 
act as a staging location in preparation for the release to become official.

### Pre-upload notification ### {#heads-up}

Most projects can just distribute a release as described in the previous two
questions.  However, releases that are likely to strain the mirroring and
download resources **must** be coordinated with infrastructure.

Releases of more than 1GB of artifacts require a heads-up to Infrastructure in
advance.

Specific exemptions from other dist policies (such as what may or must or must
not be distributed via the mirrors) also need to be coordinated with Infrastructure.

## Release signing ### {#release-signing}

Every artifact distributed by the Apache Software Foundation  *must* be
accompanied by one file containing an [OpenPGP
compatible ASCII armored detached signature](#openpgp-ascii-detach-sig) and
another file containing an [MD5 checksum](#md5). The names of these files
*must* be formed by adding to the name of the artifact the following
suffixes:

- the signature by suffixing `.asc` 

- the checksum by suffixing `.md5` 

An [SHA](#sha-checksum) checksum *should* also be created and *must* be
suffixed `.sha`.

Release managers *must not* store private keys used to sign Apache releases
on ASF hardware.

The private key *must not* be store on any ASF machine. So, signatures
*must not* be created on ASF machines.

Sensitive operations using a private key *must not* be executed on ASF
hardware.

The files that make up an Apache release are **always** accompanied by
cryptographic signatures.

It is vital that hash, signature and KEYS files are only downloaded from ASF hosts.
So the following files are excluded from synchronisation:

*.md5 *.MD5 *.sha1 *.sha *.sha256 *.sha512 *.asc *.sig KEYS KEYS.txt MD5SUM SHA*SUM

MD5SUM and SHA*SUM must look like the output of md5sum(1): lines containing
a checksum, followed by a filename ; use only plain filenames (no slashes).

Do not use any other file names for such files.

### PGP Signatures ### {#pgp}

The source package must be
[cryptographically signed](/dev/release-signing.html) by the Release
Manager with a detached signature; and that package together with its
signature must be tested prior to voting +1 for release. Folks who vote +1
for release may offer their own cryptographic signature to be concatenated
with the detached signature file (at the Release Manager's discretion)
prior to release.

Now that there is doubt about the medium term security of [SHA-1](#sha1) ,
the DSA keys and 1024 bit RSA keys (which depend on this algorithm) should
be avoided for new keys. It is uncertain whether 2048 bit RSA keys will be
strong enough to remain secure until [SHA3](#sha3) (and the next generation
of standards) arrives. It is therefore recommended that new keys should be
at least 4096 bit RSA (the longest widely supported key length).

Keys used at Apache should be available through the global [public
keyserver](release-signing.html#keyserver) network. 

Projects maintain [KEYS](release-signing.html#keys-policy) files containing
the public keys used to sign Apache releases. These documents need not be
updated immediately, but they **MUST** be updated with an export before any
release is published using the new key.

It is vital that Apache code signing keys are linked into a strong [web of
trust](release-signing.html#web-of-trust). This allows independent
verification of the fidelity of Apache releases by anyone strongly linked
to this web. In particular, this enables to two important groups to
independently verify releases:

- The Apache Infrastructure Team
- Downstream packagers

The Apache web of trust is reasonably well connected to the wider open
source web of trust. So though every opportunity should be taken to link
into wider networks the most important action needs to be to plan to
exchange signatures with other Apache committers.

If your key has been compromised then you **MUST NOT** transition but
[revoke](#revoke-key) the old key and replace with a new one immediately.
**DO NOT** use a transition period.

If your key has been compromised, you **MUST NOT** use a transition period.
You should immediately [revoke](release-signing.html#revoke-key) the
compromised key and [create a new one](openpgp.html#generate-key). All [web
of trust](release-signing.html#web-of-trust) links signed by the old key
should be regarded as suspect. A completely new set of links **MUST** be
re-established by meeting [in
person](release-signing.html#key-signing-party).

All web of
trust links signed by the old key should be regarded as suspect. A completely
new set of links MUST be re-established by meeting in person.

- Committers with a DSA key or an RSA key of length less than 2048 bits
should generate a new key for signing releases. The original key does not
need to be revoked yet. Follow this [guide](key-transition.html).

- Committers with RSA keys of length 2048 or more do not need to generate a
new key yet. They should reconfigure their client to avoid the weakness by
following these [instructions](openpgp.html#sha1) and wait for the next
major OpenPGP revision.

Signatures should be [ASCII armored and
detached](#openpgp-ascii-detach-sig).

Your [public key](#public-private) should be [exported](#export) and the
result appended to the appropriate<code> [KEYS](#keys-policy)
</code>file(s).

### Checksums ### {#checksums}

Please note that further use of `SHA-1` should be [avoided](#sha1).

`SHA256` and `SHA512` use the same `SHA` algorithm family with longer hash
lengths (256 and 512 bits respectively). These longer variations are less
vulnerable to the weaknesses found in the algorithm family than `SHA1`.
SHA512 is [recommended](#sha1).

## Download links {#download-links}

Current releases must be served from the ASF mirroring system by placing them under
`http://www.apache.org/dist/`.  (How to upload releases to the `dist/`
tree is [explained](#upload-scp) [below](#upload-ci).) 

Project download
pages must link to the mirrors and not to the main Apache Web site; see
[instructions for creating download pages](release-download-pages) for
fuller details. 
The website documentation for the software must contain a link to the download page for the source.

Project websites (`http://{project}.apache.org`),
VMs (`http://{project}.zones.apache.org` and `http://{project}-vm.apache.org`),
and source control repositories (`svn.apache.org` and Git repositories)
may not be used to distribute releases --- that is, releases should not be
downloaded from them.

- All links to the mirrored distribution artifacts **must not** reference
the main Apache web site. They *should* use the standard mechanisms to
distribute the load between the mirrors.

- All links to checksums, detached signatures and public keys **must**
reference the main Apache web site and *should* use https:// (SSL).

- Old releases *should* be [archived](release.html#how-to-archive) and may
be linked from the download page.

- Artifacts which are not full official releases (for example, milestones,
betas and alphas) may be linked from the download page. Links to these
artifacts should be removed in a timely fashion.

Links to the checksum and signature for the artifact should be given next
to the download link. It is important that users check the sum and verify
the signature so these links should be close and clear. **Note:** these
documents *must not* be mirrored.

## Release archival ## {#archival}

All releases must be archived on <http://archive.apache.org/dist/>.

An automated process adds releases to the archive about a day after
they first appear on to <http://www.apache.org/dist/>.
Once a release
is placed under `http://www.apache.org/dist/` it will automatically be copied over
to `http://archive.apache.org/dist/` and held there permanently, even after it is deleted
from `http://www.apache.org/dist/`.

If you have (legacy?) releases that never got archived, 
ask infra to copy them to `http://archive.apache.org/dist/`.

`/www.apache.org/dist` should contain *the latest release in each branch 
that is currently under development*. When development ceases on a version 
branch, releases of that branch should be removed from `/dist`.

(If the project uses svnpubsub, 
this is done by deleting the artifacts from 
`https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/<TLP name>/`.)

For example, if Apache Foo 1.2.x is a newer release in the same line as 
Foo 1.1.a, then 1.1.a should be removed when 1.2.x is released.
Note that all releases are automatically archived,
see [How Is An Old Release Moved To The Archives](#how-to-archive)

If Apache Foo 1.2 is a new branch, and development continues on 1.1 in 
parallel, then it is acceptable to serve both 1.1.a and 1.2.x from `/dist`.

`/www.apache.org/dist` is automatically archived. Therefore, a copy of an
official release will already exist in the archives. To move a release to
the archives, just delete the copy in `/www.apache.org/dist`. Remember to
update any links from the download page.

## Downstream distribution {#downstream}

### Maven {#maven}

In addition to the distribution directory, project that use Maven or
a related build tool sometimes place their
releases on `repository.apache.org` beside some convenience binaries. 
The distribution directory is required, 
while the repository system is an optional convenience.

Apache operates a repository manager at https://repository.apache.org/. It can
be used by Apache projects for deploying snapshots, releases, or both. See the
Publishing Maven Releases guide for more details.

The *snapshot* repositories are for interim *snapshot* releases and the
*ibiblio* repositories are for releasing via rsync to the 'central' Maven
repository.

## Policy Administration ## {#administration}

Changes to Release Distribution Policy MUST be approved by the V.P. of Apache
Infrastructure.
